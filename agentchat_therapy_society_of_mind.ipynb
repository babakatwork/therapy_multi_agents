    "This notebook demonstrates the SocietyOfMindAgent, which runs a group chat as an internal monologue, but appears to the external world as a single agent. This confers three distinct advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It provides a clean way of producing a hierarchy of agents, hiding complexity as inner monologues.\n",
    "2. It provides a consistent way of extracting an answer from a lengthy group chat (normally, it is not clear which message is the final response, and the response itself may not always be formatted in a way that makes sense when extracted as a standalone message).\n",
    "3. It provides a way of recovering when agents exceed their context window constraints (the inner monologue is protected by try-catch blocks)\n",

I would also suggest involving a translator if necessary to ensure that Maryam can fully participate in the therapy and express herself in her own language.\n",
