**Diagnostic Assessment:**
Based on Jane's self-reported symptoms—including persistent sadness, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, feelings of hopelessness, social withdrawal, and strained romantic relationships—it is appropriate to consider a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). These symptoms align with the DSM-5 criteria for MDD, which requires at least five symptoms present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning. Jane's family history of depression and anxiety could also suggest a genetic predisposition, contributing to her current mental health challenges.

**Therapeutic Goals:**
1. **Reduce depressive symptoms:** Aim to decrease the intensity and frequency of symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, and lack of interest.
2. **Improve social engagement:** Encourage gradual reintegration into social activities and rebuilding of relationships with friends and family.
3. **Enhance communication skills:** Develop strategies to improve communication with her partner, focusing on expressing emotions and needs effectively.
4. **Career guidance and support:** Assist in addressing concerns related to unemployment, which may be contributing to her stress and self-esteem issues.
5. **Promote healthy routines:** Establish a structured daily routine including consistent sleep patterns, physical activity, and balanced nutrition.

**Interventions:**
- **CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy):** Implement cognitive restructuring to address negative thought patterns and behavioral activation to increase engagement in rewarding activities. This can help in modifying the pessimistic views and behaviors that perpetuate depression.
- **DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy):** Introduce mindfulness exercises to help Jane become more aware of her thoughts and feelings without judgment. Skills from the emotional regulation module can help manage intense emotions that affect her social and romantic relationships.
- **ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy):** Use acceptance and mindfulness strategies combined with commitment and behavior-change strategies to increase psychological flexibility. This would involve clarifying Jane's values and committing to behavior that aligns with these values despite negative feelings.
- **EFT (Emotionally Focused Therapy):** Focus on rebuilding the attachment with her partner and addressing the emotional disconnect in her relationships. This involves creating a secure bond and enhancing emotional availability to improve intimacy.
- **IFS (Internal Family Systems):** Explore and address potential internal conflicts and parts (e.g., an inner critic or a vulnerable child) that may be contributing to Jane's depressive state and her withdrawal from relationships.

**Ethical Considerations:**
- **Confidentiality:** Ensure that Jane's privacy and confidentiality are maintained throughout the therapeutic process, except in cases where there might be a risk of harm.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Consider Jane's cultural background and family history of mental illness in all therapeutic interactions to ensure that cultural values and family dynamics are respected and integrated into the treatment.
- **Informed Consent:** Clearly explain all aspects of the therapy processes, including the use of different therapeutic models and what Jane can expect from them.
- **Avoiding Bias:** Be vigilant about not imposing personal beliefs or biases about mental health, career success, or relationship norms on Jane. It's important to validate her experiences from her perspective.

In conclusion, the treatment plan should be multi-faceted, integrating approaches from CBT, DBT, ACT, EFT, and IFS to address Jane's symptoms, improve her interpersonal relationships, and help her align her actions with her personal values and goals. Regular review and adjustment of the treatment plan will be necessary to respond to her changing needs and progress.
