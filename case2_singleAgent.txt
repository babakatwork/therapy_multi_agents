### Diagnostic Assessment

Jimmy presents with behavioral challenges characterized by disruptive behaviors, refusal to follow instructions, difficulty in forming peer relationships, low self-esteem, and poor frustration tolerance. These symptoms suggest several possible diagnostic directions. The disruptive behaviors in multiple settings (school and home) could be indicative of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), characterized by frequent anger, irritability, and defiance towards authority figures. However, given the family dynamics, stressors, and his difficulty in peer relationships, an assessment for an Adjustment Disorder might also be relevant, as Jimmy might be struggling to adjust to ongoing family stress and conflict. Further evaluation would be necessary to rule out any underlying mood disorders or learning disabilities that could be contributing to his behavioral issues.

### Therapeutic Goals

**Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)**:
- Enhance emotional awareness and expression within family interactions.
- Strengthen attachment bonds between Jimmy and his parents to foster a secure, supportive environment.

**Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)**:
- Develop Jimmy’s skills in identifying and modifying negative thoughts, improving his behavior and emotional regulation.
- Enhance problem-solving skills and coping strategies for handling frustration.

**Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)**:
- Teach Jimmy mindfulness techniques to better manage his emotions and impulses.
- Introduce distress tolerance skills for better frustration management.

**Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT)**:
- Work on accepting difficult emotions and thoughts without overly reacting to them.
- Encourage committed action towards valued behaviors at home and school.

**Integrative Family Systems (IFS)**:
- Address family patterns and roles that may be contributing to stress and behavioral issues.
- Foster a healthier family system where each member’s needs are acknowledged and addressed.

### Interventions

A multi-modal approach integrating techniques from various therapeutic orientations can be highly beneficial:

- **Family Therapy Sessions (EFT/IFS)**: Conduct family therapy to address and modify the interaction patterns that contribute to Jimmy’s behaviors and to support his sister with her challenges. This could involve EFT techniques to enhance emotional expression and repair attachment ruptures, and IFS interventions to recognize and reposition family roles and dynamics.

- **Individual Therapy for Jimmy (CBT/DBT/ACT)**: Use CBT to help Jimmy recognize and alter negative thought patterns and behaviors. Implement DBT strategies to enhance his emotional and impulse control through mindfulness and distress tolerance exercises. Use ACT to help him align his actions with his valued outcomes, like forming friendships and improving family relationships.

- **Parental Guidance and Support (CBT/EFT)**: Educate and involve parents in interventions that help them understand and effectively respond to Jimmy’s needs, potentially using EFT to improve emotional connections and CBT for managing their own stress and responses.

### Ethical Considerations

- **Cultural Sensitivity**: It’s crucial to consider and respect the family’s Taiwanese cultural background in therapy, ensuring culturally appropriate interventions are chosen and implemented. This includes understanding family dynamics, values, and expectations in the context of their culture.

- **Confidentiality and Autonomy**: Ensure Jimmy’s confidentiality is maintained while also respecting his age and developmental stage. Engage him in discussions about his treatment to foster autonomy.

- **Multiple Relationships**: Navigating family therapy where multiple family members are clients requires careful consideration of boundaries and dynamics to manage potential conflicts of interest.

- **Resource Accessibility**: Given the family’s financial stress, the treatment plan should consider the accessibility of resources, recommending services that are financially feasible.

This consensus treatment plan provides a holistic, integrated approach to therapy, aiming to address both the individual and family challenges while considering ethical and cultural dimensions of the case.
